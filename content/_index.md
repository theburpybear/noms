Hi! I'm Clarice Hong, a postdoctoral fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the Anders Hansen Lab, where I investigate ultra-high-resolution 3D genome structure and long-range enhancer activity through live-cell imaging.

I completed my Ph.D. in Molecular Genetics and Genomics at Washington University in St. Louis, studying the integration of cis-regulatory information in the genome, the impact of genomic environments on gene expression noise, and the high-throughput discovery of cell-type specific enhancers in mouse brains using single-cell MPRA. I'm passionate about advancing our understanding of genome structure and function, and I continue to contribute to groundbreaking discoveries in the field of molecular genetics and genomics.
